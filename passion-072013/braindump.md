# How To Get Your Dreams in 5000 Words or Less and Live in the Woods and Work on The Internet

This is a talk about passion and balance and purpose.

There have been a few points in my life where I wasn't a bumbling mess getting in my own way and sabotaging my way into making a mess of everything. One of those times was when I decided to send a 5000 word email to adam@andyet.com applying for a job from a 2 month old blog post that I was in no way qualified for.

There was fear.
100 different ways it could've been considered stupid.
But there was a nagging feeling.

[Then you should do it](http://thepot-luck.com/adambrault/then-you-should-do-it/)

I had no idea Adam Brault would write this.

So I did it.

So I went to RealtimeConf.

When writing the initial email, whether it was me or not (most of the time I feel like in that moment I was guided by fate or a greater power more than anything), I had visions of a job that I ["big-L Loved"](http://thepot-luck.com/ericzanol/a-recovering-wannabe/). The kind of job where I could make a difference. And also the kind of job that was fucking hard. The kind of job that you don't get to sit back when you don't feel like putting your whole self forward. The kind of job that requires the full you and all the rewards and consequences that come with that. I wanted that.

I got scared too. And it was hard. I've messed up (ahem, learning experiences) since I started in January. I've felt completely in over my head. I've felt helpless and like no one on earth could be as stupid as me for thinking they could succeed at a job they dreamed about. I wrote a resignation later. But deep down I still wanted it.

Why do I love my job so much?


I have no idea what I'm doing.
Everyone I work with knows this.
Everyone is their whole self.

Cliche alert:
It doesn't feel like work.
But that doesn't mean I want to do it all the time.

Balance. I feel like that's a magical word that gets thrown around a lot. I also feel like I don't understand it.

I used to think balance meant being home from work at a certain time. I feel balanced now even when I stay up until 2am coding. Because the job fills me up, it doesn't drain me. And when it does drain me, I have people. Coworkers who I love. Family who I love.

My house is shouting distance from my sister, brother-in-law and their three children. My office is in my mom's spare room where her, I, my brother-in-law split a T1 line. It's on the edge of the national forest. It's made up of dirt roads. I almost exclusively see people who I know very well in an average day. I am engaged to a person who I am positively ecstatic to be spending the rest of my life with and who understands more than I do everything I've been trying to say so far (and I often forget). So I'm with the people I love. In the place I belong.

But I forget. Oh man I'm fucking forgetful.

I followed the email response to RealtimeConf and saw Adam speak about [tiny leaders](https://speakerdeck.com/adambrault/realtimeconf-closing)

I left inspired and determined. Working for &yet was the work that was mine.

I started working there in January.

This is where purpose comes in.

On purpose.

What does "on purpose" mean? Not on accident. It also means action. Doing something.

Living in the place you belong.
With the people you love.
Doing the work that's yours.

On purpose.

I consider myself highly lucky.

I live in the woods. It is where I belong right now.

With the people I love. I am literally shouting distance from my nephews, brothers, sisters, and am engaged to marry a person I am positively ecstatic to be spending the rest of my life with.

Doing the work that is yours. I work for a company and with me that understand me. They understand me deeper than my job description and are constantly there to support me and help me grow in ways I never imagined. I feel ownership of everything within the company. The work is simultaneously mine and everyone's who works there.

But on purpose? On purpose takes work. I can keep doing those same three things. And nothing could change. But I could be unhappy if I'm not doing those things on purpose.

Without doing those things on purpose they will become a drag. No matter if nothing about them or me changes.

On purpose. If I am doing those things on purpose, I can never forget how lucky I am or how they make me feel. If I am active in my Love for them, how could I ever be unfulfilled?

Of course there are problems.

I battle depression.
Anxiety.
Anger.

I can sabotage myself at the drop of a hat and convince myself that

I don't belong anywhere
No one loves me
Most could do my job better than me

But those feelings only result from the lack of purpose.

If I really, really think. I mean really, I would have to be a stark raving mad fool to do any of those three things on purpose. They can creep in, just as dark thoughts can do.

But I can always play the purpose card.

All that is necessary for the triumph of evil is that good men do nothing.

All that is necessary for me to be fulfilled in my place, people and work is to have purpose.
